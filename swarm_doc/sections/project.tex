\chapter{Project Document}\label{ch:ch2label}

This part is about the conceptual work of this project. ...

\section{Local vs. Global Positioning}
- discussion of local (through sonar) and global (through camera tracking) 
- discussion of object differentiation techniques + crosstalk between copters
- decision 

\section{Camera Tracking}
- where to find and what branch to use
- obtaining positions using copter tracking
- use of bag files
- visualization for the positions and forces in RVIZ

\section{Communication with the copter}
- Camera Tracking position into GPS (GPS Injection)
- Structure of GPS message
- IVY communication and how it works and why we use it? + link
- Receiving and Broadcasting INS data
- Structure of INS message 

\section{Swarming}

\subsection{Forces}
- Distance and Force Calculation for and from each copter
- debugging the Swarming code
- structure of Swarming module (callback, periodic processing)

\subsection{Movement}
- Setting way-points
- Navigation (switching flight Modes)
- trying to control cmd_roll cmd_pitch (In Progress)
